## Preface

Nice to meet you here. :smiley: I'm Carry. This is my website to record something I wanna share with you. You can regard it as my archive where I write down my experience and works during my academic journey at least right now. 

I used to explore how to enable the research on building energy efficiency :house_with_garden: with advanced AI technologies. The subfields I am involved in mainly include **Automatic Design of HVAC**, **Data Analysis for Building Energy Consumption**, **Data-Driven Methods to Improve Building Energy Efficiency** :office:. 

Now I am researching **Image Signal Pipeline (ISP)** :camera:, They are completely different but yet inextricably related :monocle_face:. We are always trying to apply mathematical theories to engineering problems. 

Hope something can inspire you :bulb: and feel free to take away whatever you think is useful :brain:.

## Abstract

I will talk about my archive in an abstract. If you were familiar with my past major, you would definitely know some relevant career prospects, for instance, graduates are likely to choose some architecture design institutes. One of my past research interests is about how to decrease repeatable and time-consuming design works with the help of software development, so we want to optimize HVAC design that ensure the thermal comfort in built-environment. 

1. [Auto-Zone Construction for Smoke Control](https://carrybio.netlify.app/posts/blog9/)

2. [Automatic Hydraulic Calculation for Centralized Air Distribution Systems](https://carrybio.netlify.app/posts/blog10/)

Another field is closely related to enpower Building Energy Efficiency with advanced mathematical tools.

1. I tried to explore [the status quo of big engineering HVAC data](https://carrybio.netlify.app/posts/blog11/) that is the source of everything, and proposed [a relatively generic framework for data preprocessing]((https://carrybio.netlify.app/posts/blog15/).

2. Internship encourages me to explore [reinforcement-learning](https://carrybio.netlify.app/posts/blog14/) or [other methods]((https://carrybio.netlify.app/posts/blog13/) to improve building energy efficiency or fault detection and diagnosis.

## Future Plan

I have been updating my archive to make a little bit contribution to open-source spirit. 

## Acknowlegde

Lastly say big big thank you to [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and [paper-theme](https://github.com/nanxiaobei/hugo-paper) to facilitate my archive establishment.
